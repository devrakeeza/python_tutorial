# Python Programming: Lecture 1 - Introduction and Basics

Welcome to the first lecture of our Python programming course! In this lecture, we will cover the following topics:
1. Introduction to Python 
2. Installation and setup
3. Basic data types
4. Variables
5. Arithmetic operations
6. User input

1. Introduction to Python

Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language, designed by Guido van Rossum in 1991. It emphasizes readability and simplicity, making it an excellent language for beginners and experienced developers. Python has a wide range of applications, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.

2. Installation and setup

To start working with Python, you need to have it installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/). Once installed, you can use the Python interpreter to run your code or use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code or PyCharm for a more comprehensive coding experience.

3. Basic data types

Python has several built-in data types. Here are some of the most commonly used ones:

- Integer (int): Represents whole numbers, e.g., 5, -3, 42.
- Float (float): Represents decimal numbers, e.g., 3.14, -0.5, 1.0.
- String (str): Represents a sequence of characters, e.g., "Hello, World!", 'Python'.
- Boolean (bool): Represents true or false values, e.g., True, False.

4. Variables

Variables are used to store data in Python. You don't need to declare the data type of a variable explicitly. Python automatically detects the type based on the value you assign. Here's an example:

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30
height = 5.6
is_student = True
```
5. Arithmetic operations

Python supports basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. Here's an example:
```python
a = 10
b = 3

sum = a + b
difference = a - b
product = a * b
quotient = a / b
remainder = a % b

print("Sum:", sum)
print("Difference:", difference)
print("Product:", product)
print("Quotient:", quotient)
print("Remainder:", remainder)
```

6. User input

To get input from the user, you can use the input() function. The function returns a string, so if you want to use the input as a number, you need to convert it using int() or float() functions. Here's an example:

```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

print("Hello,", name)
print("You are", age, "years old.")
```
That concludes our first lecture on Python programming. In the next lecture, we will cover more advanced topics, such as conditional statements, loops, and functions. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask!
