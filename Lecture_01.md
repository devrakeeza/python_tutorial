1. Introduction to Python

Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language, designed by Guido van Rossum in 1991. It emphasizes readability and simplicity, making it an excellent language for beginners and experienced developers. Python has a wide range of applications, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.

2. Installation and setup

To start working with Python, you need to have it installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/). Once installed, you can use the Python interpreter to run your code or use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code or PyCharm for a more comprehensive coding experience.

3. Basic data types

Python has several built-in data types. Here are some of the most commonly used ones:

Integer (int): Represents whole numbers, e.g., 5, -3, 42.
Float (float): Represents decimal numbers, e.g., 3.14, -0.5, 1.0.
String (str): Represents a sequence of characters, e.g., "Hello, World!", 'Python'.
Boolean (bool): Represents true or false values, e.g., True, False.
